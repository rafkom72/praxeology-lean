# Praxeology in Lean 4

A formalization of the Hilbert-style axiomatization of praxeology
following Komendarczyk, Block, Levendis, and Tipler,
"A Formalization of Austrian Economics --- Praxeological
Foundations" (2026).

This file is **self-contained**: it imports nothing and uses only
Lean 4 core (no Mathlib). If everything compiles cleanly, every
theorem and every axiom of the Crusoe model is verified.

## What this file verifies

The Crusoe instance is the **nets-and-boats** Crusoe of the
Foundations paper §3.6, extended in anticipation of future
research with a production enrichment (Result/Consumable
predicates, higher-order-goods hierarchy). Five actions
(Forage, BuildNet, ShoreFish, BuildBoat, DeepSeaFish), four
ends (Subsist, Capital, ShoreCatch, DeepCatch — BuildNet and
BuildBoat share the Capital end), six things (Wood, Net, Boat,
Plant, Fish, Tuna), three time points (t0 < t1 < t2).
Availability menus grow monotonically as capital accumulates
({2 actions} ⊂ {4} ⊂ {5}); Crusoe's chosen history is
BuildNet@t0, BuildBoat@t1, DeepSeaFish@t2. Recipes (Use/Result):
BuildNet uses Wood, produces Net; ShoreFish uses Net, produces
Fish; BuildBoat uses Wood, produces Boat; DeepSeaFish uses
Net+Boat, produces Tuna; Forage produces Plant (no input).
Three things are consumable: Plant, Fish, Tuna.

Lean verifies (i) every base axiom T1–T4, P1–P5, C1 by exhaustive
case analysis; (ii) the standard derived theorems (asymmetry of
revealed preference, opportunity cost) on this model; (iii) every
CrusoeThing has a finite Order in the recursive higher-order-goods
hierarchy (Plant/Fish/Tuna at order 1, Net/Boat at order 2,
Wood at order 3). Acceptance of the `crusoeModel` instance is a
constructive consistency proof of T_prx (with the production
enrichment) on this model.

Section 8 adds the full base theory `PraxeologyFull` (the
remaining time axioms T0/T5/T6, free-good exclusion P6, the
scarcity anchor S1, and Layer 2: the valuational primitive `Pref`
with grounding (O0) and order axioms (O1)–(O4)).  Sections 9–11
add the (MU)-enrichment of the Foundations paper §3.2, as a class
`PraxeologyMU` that *extends `PraxeologyFull`*: the new sort
`Good`, the predicates `UnitOf`, `Allot`, (MU0) functionality and
(MU1) feasibility,
the homogeneity axiom (MU2), the scarcity axiom (MU3), and (MU4)
top-segment — in its corrected form, relativized to the good's
*serviceable* ends.  The order on which marginal utility operates
is the base theory's own scale of values, inherited (no separate
MU preference relation).  Then the diminishing-marginal-utility
theorem (`thm:DMU`) and its structure-preservation corollary
(`cor:dmu_structure`) are stated and machine-verified, mirroring
`app:dmu_proof`.

Section 12 adds the joint witness: the two-good water/fish
allotment schedule from the Crusoe box accompanying (MU4) in the
paper, in which two goods alternate down a single value scale,
realized over ℕ-time so that it satisfies the *full* base theory,
the production enrichment, and the (MU)-enrichment in one
structure.  Lean's acceptance of `waterFishModel` proves the
relativized (MU4) admits this multi-good case, and an `example`
verifies that the old *unrelativized* form of (MU4) fails on it —
the reason the axiom had to be corrected.

Further enrichments — ownership, exchange, monetary calculation,
and the transition map — are deferred to future Lean stages,
paralleling the future-research directions sketched in §5
of the Foundations paper.

-- SECTION 1.  The Praxeological Class (base + E5)
----------------------------------------------------------------

/-- A `Praxeology` packages the sorts, primitive relations, and
    axioms of the formal language L_prx from the paper. An *instance*
    of this class is a *model* of the theory T_prx in the sense of
    Hilbert and Tarski: a structure satisfying all the axioms.

    The five sorts are: Actor, Action, EndE, Thing, Time.
    The base primitive relations are: Lt, Acts, Avail, EndOf, Use.
    The E5 production-enrichment relations are: Result, Consumable.

    Note: we name the sort of ends `EndE` because `End` is reserved
    by Lean. -/

-- SECTION 2.  Revealed Preference  (definition, not axiom)
----------------------------------------------------------------

/-- The *revealed-preference relation* (`def:revpref` of the
    Foundations paper): `RevPref a t E F` says actor `a` puts end
    `E` over end `F` on record at time `t` — `a` chose an action
    whose end is `E` while an action whose end is the *different*
    end `F` was simultaneously available.  The leading `E ≠ F`
    clause excludes the degenerate self-revelation that means-ends
    multiplicity would otherwise generate (two available actions
    sharing one end).  Under the paper's redesign the record is
    *defined* from choice, while the preference order itself is a
    primitive grounded in the record by axiom (O0) — see
    `PraxeologyFull` below. -/
def Praxeology.RevPref [P : Praxeology]
    (a : P.Actor) (t : P.Time) (E F : P.EndE) : Prop :=
  E ≠ F ∧ ∃ α β : P.Action,
    P.Acts a α t ∧ P.Avail a β t ∧ α ≠ β ∧
    P.EndOf α E ∧ P.EndOf β F

----------------------------------------------------------------
-- SECTION 3.  The higher-order-goods hierarchy (E5 derived)
----------------------------------------------------------------

/-- The recursive `Order(x, n)` predicate of the production-enrichment (future research)
    A consumable good has order 1; a good `x` used by some action
    whose result is at order `n` is itself at order `n+1`.
    The two PH-axioms (PH1 value-dependency, PH2 grounding-in-
    consumption) follow respectively from the constructors of this
    inductive type and from the per-instance theorem
    `*_Order_total` proved below. -/

----------------------------------------------------------------

namespace Praxeology
variable [P : Praxeology]

/-- **Lemma.**  If actor `a` reveals **both** `E ≻ F` and `F ≻ E`
    at the same time `t`, then `E = F`.

    *Proof.* Each preference revelation gives us a chosen action.
    By the choice axiom C1, the two chosen actions must be equal.
    By the unique-end axiom P4, that single action's end is both
    `E` and `F`, hence `E = F`. -/
theorem revPref_eq_of_both
    (a : P.Actor) (t : P.Time) (E F : P.EndE)
    (h₁ : RevPref a t E F) (h₂ : RevPref a t F E) : E = F := by

  rw [heq] at hα₁_E
  exact P.P4 α₂ E F hα₁_E hα₂_F

/-- **Asymmetry of revealed preference (`thm:asymm`).**  Valid
    without restriction: the `E ≠ F` clause of the definition
    makes the reflexive instance vacuous, so — unlike the
    pre-redesign form — no distinctness hypothesis is needed.
    A single moment of conduct cannot put contradictory pairs on
    record. -/

    (h : RevPref a t E F) : ¬ RevPref a t F E := by
  intro h'
  exact h.1 (revPref_eq_of_both a t E F h h')

/-- **Foregone-action lemma.**
    If actor `a` performs some action `α` at time `t`, and a
    distinct action `β` is available at that time, then `β` is
    *foregone* — available but not realized. This is the
    choice-axiom (C1) half of opportunity cost: the chosen action
    crowds out every other action. (Formerly named
    `opportunity_cost`; that name now denotes the stronger,
    distinct-ends result below, matching the paper's
    `thm:opp_cost`.) -/

  intro hβ_acts
  exact hαβ (P.C1 a t α β hα_acts hβ_acts)

/-- **Existence of opportunity cost (`thm:opp_cost`).**
    If two actions `α, β` are available at `(a,t)` with *distinct*
    ends `E ≠ F`, then the action `γ` actually performed excludes
    at least one alternative *available* end: there is an available
    action `δ` whose end `G` the performed action does not realize,
    and `δ` is itself foregone. Mirrors the paper's proof — the
    performed action has a unique end by `P4`, so it cannot realize
    two distinct available ends; the unrealized one is the
    opportunity cost, and its action is not performed by `C1`.
    (In the full theory `O1` supplies the performed action `γ`;
    here it is taken as a hypothesis.) Every hypothesis is
    load-bearing: `γ`-performed and `C1` give the not-performed
    clause, `P4` the unrealized-end clause, availability the
    witness, and `E ≠ F` the exclusion. -/

/-! Concrete `Praxeology` instance: the three-period Crusoe economy
    of §3.6 of the Foundations paper, extended with the production
    enrichment E5 anticipated in future research.  Crusoe inhabits a
    small island with access to
    coastal and deep-sea resources. The choice menu grows
    monotonically as capital accumulates. The recipe-DAG is
    (Wood, Net, Boat at the higher orders; Plant, Fish, Tuna at the
    consumption layer):

-- SECTION 8.  The full base theory T_prx  (Layers 1 + 2 + 3)
----------------------------------------------------------------

/-! The class `Praxeology` above encodes the *action core* of the
    Foundations paper — the fragment (T1)–(T4), (P1)–(P5), (C1)
    that the paper's Appendix A calls "the encoded core."  The
    full base theory adds the remaining time axioms ((T0) first
    moment, (T5) irreversibility, (T6) discreteness), free-good
    exclusion (P6), the scarcity anchor (S1), and Layer 2: the
    valuational primitive `Pref` — the actor's scale of values —
    together with the grounding axiom (O0) and the order axioms
    (O1)–(O4), per the paper's §2.3 redesign.

    (T6) gives every moment a successor, so the full theory has
    **no finite models**: the three-period Crusoe instance above
    cannot witness it.  Section 13 provides the ℕ-time witness;
    the joint base+E5+MU witness `waterFishModel` (Section 12) is
    over ℕ-time for the same reason.

    The (MU)-enrichment of Section 9 *extends this class*, so the
    valuational primitive `Pref` and the order axioms (O2)–(O4)
    used by the diminishing-marginal-utility theorem are exactly
    the base theory's scale of values — there is no separate MU
    preference relation. -/

-- SECTION 9.  The (MU)-enrichment (§3.2)
----------------------------------------------------------------

/-- The `PraxeologyMU` class extends `PraxeologyFull` with the
    production/allocation primitives and the (MU)-axioms of §3.2.
    Because it extends the *full base theory*, every instance is a
    single structure satisfying the base theory, the production
    enrichment (E5, idle in the witness below), and the
    (MU)-enrichment jointly.  There is no separate MU preference
    relation: `Pref` and the order axioms (O0)–(O4) are inherited
    from `PraxeologyFull` and reused verbatim — the scale of values
    on which diminishing marginal utility operates is the base
    theory's own.

    New primitives (beyond the full base theory):
      * `Good`    : a sort partitioning Things into homogeneous
                    classes.
      * `UnitOf`  : x is a unit of good g.
      * `Allot`   : actor a at time t allots unit x to end E (the
                    allocation schedule, distinct from performance).

    (MU)-axioms encoded here:
      * `MU0_func`  : (MU0) functionality — each unit
                      allots to at most one end.
      * `MU1_feas`  : (MU1) feasibility — only feasible
                      cells are populated (the right-hand side is
                      `Serviceable`, inlined).  Underwrites
                      `lem:served_choice_relevant`.
      * `MU2_homog` : (MU2) homogeneity of units (menu-level) — if
                      some unit of g can serve E via an available
                      action, then so can any other unit of g.  A
                      substantive modeling commitment, not a
                      bookkeeping convention.
      * `MU3_scarce`: (MU3) scarcity for good g (cardinal-free) —
                      some choice-relevant end is not served by g.
                      Stated via the derived predicates `EndAt`,
                      `Served`, inlined to avoid a forward reference.
      * `MU4_top`   : (MU4) preference-respecting allocation — the
                      served set is a top-segment of the
                      *g-serviceable* choice-relevant ends under
                      `Pref`.  The serviceability qualifier confines
                      the requirement to ends within the good's
                      reach (see `waterFishModel` below).

    The order axioms (O2)–(O4) and finiteness of the choice menu
    (`rem:finiteness`) turn non-emptiness of the reduced served set
    into existence and uniqueness of its marginal end (Step 2 of
    `app:dmu_proof`).  (MU2)/(MU3) are not invoked by the DMU
    theorem itself, but are now part of the class and verified on
    the joint witness. -/

/-- **Theorem (Diminishing marginal utility)** ---
    Theorem `thm:DMU`, in the paper's tightened form: the
    reduced marginal end `E*` is *derived*, not assumed.

    Let `y` be a unit of good `g` allotted at `(a,t)` to a
    choice-relevant end `E`.  Suppose:
      (i)   *Uniqueness on E* --- no other unit of `g` is
            allotted to `E`.
      (ii)  *Marginality of E* --- `E` is the least-preferred
            end currently served by `g` at `(a,t)`
            (Definition `def:marginal_end`).
      (iii) *Non-emptiness of the reduced supply* --- some end
            other than `E` is served by `g` at `(a,t)`
            (Mises's implicit `n ≥ 2`).
    Then the marginal end `E*` of the reduced served set
    `ServedExcept a t g y` exists, is unique, and satisfies
    `E* ≻ E`.

    Finiteness of the choice menu (`rem:finiteness`) enters as
    the hypothesis pair `menu`/`hmenu`: a list of ends covering
    the choice-relevant ends at `(a,t)`.  (No finiteness is
    assumed of the sort `EndE` itself, matching the remark.)

    The proof matches Steps 1–3 of the appendix proof
    `app:dmu_proof`: besides the hypotheses it consumes
    `lem:served_choice_relevant`, (MU0) functionality
    (which turns non-emptiness (iii) into existence of
    `E*`), and (O2)/(O3) comparability and transitivity on the
    choice menu.  (MU4) is not invoked --- it is deductively
    engaged only in `DMU_structure` below. -/

-- SECTION 11.  The two-good water/fish model (MU4 satisfiability)
----------------------------------------------------------------

/-! Concrete `PraxeologyMU` instance: the "two-good allotment
    schedule" Crusoe box accompanying (MU4) in §3.2 of the
    Foundations paper.  Robinson holds four units w1–w4 of the
    good Water and three units f1–f3 of the good Fish, with six
    choice-relevant ends ranked

        Drink ≻ Eat ≻ Cook ≻ Store ≻ Wash ≻ Garden.

    Water can serve Drink, Cook, Wash, Garden; fish can serve
    Eat, Store.  The allotment schedule (one cell per unit):

        w1 → Drink          f1 → Eat
        w2 → Cook           f2 → Eat
        w3 → Cook           f3 → Store
        w4 → Wash           (Garden unserved — an (MU3) witness)

    The two goods *alternate* down the single value scale —
    water, fish, water, fish, water — which is exactly the case
    the unrelativized (MU4) excluded: water serving Cook would
    have been faulted for Eat ≻ Cook going unserved by water,
    although water cannot serve Eat.  Lean's acceptance of this
    instance is a constructive satisfiability proof of the
    corrected, relativized axiom class on a multi-good model;
    the `example` after the instance verifies that the *old*
    unrelativized (MU4) is genuinely false here. -/

-- SECTION 13.  The ℕ-time Crusoe model: consistency of the
--              full base theory
----------------------------------------------------------------

/-! (T6) has no finite models, so the witness needs `Time := ℕ`.
    This folds the paper's state diagram into an infinite history,
    making the "walk the diagram for as many rounds as you want"
    reading a machine-checked consistency proof of the FULL base
    theory.  Two design constraints are respected:

    * **Non-greedy history.**  After building the net (t = 0) and
      the boat (t = 1), Crusoe alternates deep-sea fishing (even
      t ≥ 2) with shore fishing (odd t ≥ 3).  A greedy "always
      deep-sea" history would falsify (P6) for the boat: the only
      boat-using action would never be available-but-unperformed.

    * **Orders co-vary with the history.**  The preference ranks
      flip with the parity of t, so the chosen end always tops the
      scale and (O0) holds at every moment.  Preference reversal
      across time is licensed by `rem:constancy`. -/
